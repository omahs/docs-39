title: ⚖️ Code of Conduct
description: The Code of Conduct for SourceCred
---
(Updated February 16th, 2022)

As a community, we want to set a standard for respectful and appropriate conduct
across all communication channels. For this purpose, we have created this code 
of conduct, which serves as a guide for interaction with the SourceCred community. 

Our Standards of Behavior were ratified at a SourceCred Town Hall on October 15th,
2021. Our [Values](https://sourcecred.io/docs/beta/our-values) were ratified at a 
Town Hall on October 29th, 2021. This document was compiled from those documents, 
as well as [several well known](#license) Code of Conducts of open source projects.


## People

In the following sections:

- **we/our**: refers to the members of the SourceCred community, who exist on
  equal footing.
- **SourceCred**: refers to the general project or community.
- **Moderation Team**: The collection of SourceCred community members who have
been chosen (process to be determined) to moderate conflicts and Code of Conduct
violations. 


## Values Statement
SourceCred values…
- **Liberation**: Liberation is at the center.  
- **Care**: We take care of ourselves and each other.
- **Sovereignty**: We own our labor and value our free will.
- **Trust**: We move at the speed of trust.
- **Emergence**: We value the dynamic over the status quo.
- **Decentralization**: We share power.
We aim to act in alignment with our values, and this code of conduct has arisen
out of these values. For a more in-depth description of our values, check our 
[values page](https://sourcecred.io/docs/beta/our-values).

## Introduction & Scope

This code of conduct **should be honored by everyone who participates** in the
SourceCred community. It should be honored **in any SourceCred activities** 
including but not limited to online interactions (e.g. public and private mailing
lists, issue trackers, discussion forums, wikis, and code repositories), meetups 
or conferences, and adhered to by anyone claiming affiliation with the SourceCred
community. This code of conduct is **especially relevant for any group or individual
that is representing the SourceCred community** in an event (i.e., as speaker, 
volunteer, or other staff), and should govern standards of behaviors for the
individual's participation in said event.

This code of conduct is not exhaustive or complete, but rather serves to distill our
understanding of a collaborative community, and to provide avenues for seeking support
if this code is breached. **We should try to follow this code in spirit as much as in
letter** to create a friendly and productive environment that enriches the SourceCred
community.

Unless explicitly specified for a particular project or initiative, **this code of conduct
serves as a global standard for all SourceCred affiliated projects, activities, and events.**
If an individual is found to violate this Code of Conduct via a confidential report, at
their discretion the Moderation & Conflict Team may consult with other members from the
community and take any action they deem appropriate. Example actions might include
warning the person in question, removing them from a specific activity, or banning
them from further participation in activities (in person or online). 


## Standards for Behavior

### I. Guidelines

A. **Kindness, Empathy, and Honesty**: We strive to see the best in people, 
especially when we disagree. Honesty is a high form of respect. We don’t
make assumptions about someone’s intentions when we can be curious and 
ask them instead. We honor people’s emotions as they come up, because 
they’re a part of being human. We understand that humans make mistakes
and find value in collective and interpersonal growth.

B. **Calling in harmful behavior**: We strive to be a welcoming, safer 
environment for everyone. This means we have a commitment to calling-in
harmful language or behavior when we see it and we have a commitment to
learn how to be better to each other.
  - **If you notice harmful language or behavior**, please use your judgment on 
whether you think you should:
    1. Talk to the person privately in a 1:1 chat
    2. Ask for support from moderation, or
    3. Call it out publicly
**What will result in less harm** for those who may be affected, **and high 
likelihood of learning**? _If you feel harmed and frozen on what to do_, please
reach out for support from the Moderation Team.
  - **Dogpiling**: If there’s a moment of conflict or harm - practice discernment
in whether or not you get involved. Many people hopping on a moment of tension
can sometimes make things worse. Are you getting involved to express an opinion
or showcase your knowledge / stance? Or because there’s genuine, collective 
need for allyship?
  - Harmful behavior mentioned here does NOT include the behavior listed below 
in section II, which will result in an immediate ban.

C. **Response to call-ins or feedback**:  We have a commitment to learning about
our blindspots and noticing our own defensiveness or discomfort when blindspots
are called out. We do our absolute best to listen and reflect. We don’t jump to
conclusions about the character of the person calling out our blindspots, and
strive to instead turn towards the call-in with curiosity.

D. **Consent**: When interacting with someone whom you don’t have a prior connection
with, practice consent in all aspects. For example, get verbal consent before
sharing about a heavy topic. Make time to learn another person’s preferences and
communication styles.


### II. Behaviors that will result in an immediate ban from the SourceCred community, with no warning:

A. Any **non-consensual sexual advances**, attention, or harassment in server or in
personal messages to current server members

B. The use of **slurs or other hateful language** directed at oppressed groups 

C. **Doxxing**, i.e. publishing private contact or identifying information, like
physical or email address, phone number, etc., without the person’s explicit
permission


### III. Behaviors that will result in Moderation warnings, and then a Community Ban for repeat offenses:
A. Posting any **sexual or religious content** outside of appropriate Content-Notice
Channels

B. **Gaming**: Intentional or unintentional repeat behavior to earn Cred in ways
that does not represent actual contribution to the sourceCred community. 

C. **Trolling**, i.e. continuously provoking angry or negative reactions from server
members. Note that calling out harmful behavior / language or giving constructive
criticism is not trolling. 

**A note for Grain earners**: Bans and Kicks from SourceCred result in a ban from receiving Cred.


## Reporting Guidelines

For possibly unintentional breaches of the code of conduct, you may want to respond
to the person and point out this code of conduct (either in public or in private,
whatever is most appropriate). If you believe someone is violating the code of
conduct and have decided to submit a report, please report this in a timely manner.
Code of conduct violations reduce the value of the community for everyone. The
SourceCred community takes reports of misconduct very seriously and are committed
to preserving and maintaining the welcoming nature of our community. All complaints
will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed
necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

### Confidentiality

All reports will be kept confidential, with the exception of cases where the
Moderation Team decides it's better to publicly respond to the issue as well.
If that’s the case, the identities of all involved parties and reporters will
remain confidential unless the reporter gave permission to use their identity
for this purpose.

### How to Submit a Report

If you feel your safety is in jeopardy or the situation is an emergency, 
consider contacting local law enforcement before making a report to SourceCred.
(In the U.S., the number is 911.)

The Moderation Team on behalf of the SourceCred community is committed to
promptly addressing any reported issues. If you have experienced or witnessed
behavior that violates the SourceCred Code of Conduct, please send an email
to concerns@sourcecred.io.
